# Scene Knowledge

## Pitfalls
- Creating cyclic parent relationships
- Mutating scene data during render

## Performance
- Batch component updates
- Cache query results per frame

## Debugging
- Provide a scene graph dump on failures
- Validate component invariants in debug

## Platform Notes
- None specific; keep serialization paths normalized

# Test Knowledge

## Pitfalls
- GPU tests failing on headless systems
- Order-dependent tests

## Performance
- Keep tests small and focused
- Use focused runs for slow tests

## Debugging
- Run a single test binary with verbose output
- Record failing seeds when randomized

## Platform Notes
- Skip or guard GPU tests on unsupported platforms

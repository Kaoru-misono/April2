# <ModuleName> Role

## Summary
One sentence: what this module is responsible for.

## In Scope
- 3–8 bullet points of responsibilities

## Out of Scope
- explicitly list non-responsibilities (prevents coupling creep)

## Dependencies
- which modules this depends on (contract-level only)
- which integration docs it relies on (link paths)

## Ownership Rules
- public interface changes require updating `interfaces.md` + `changelog.md`
- breaking changes require an ADR if cross-module impact exists
